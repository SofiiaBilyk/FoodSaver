# Problem: Everyday Food Waste 
It is a widespread issue caused by many factors, including transportation damage, labor shortages, and overstocking. A large part of food waste also happens at the consumer level due to individual habits such as overbuying, poor visibility into fridge contents, confusion about expiration dates, and lack of meal planning. This leads not only to unnecessary household waste but also to a broader sustainability problem. In the U.S. alone, discarded food results in the misuse of about 30 million acres of cropland and 4.2 trillion gallons of irrigation water each year (Conrad, 2018), representing a major loss of natural resources and environmental harm.

# Solution: FoodSaver

The FoodSaver app offers a solution to reduce household food waste by helping users track, manage, and make the most of what they already have. Users can keep track of everything they have in their online fridge, logging food items manually or uploading a photo of their fridge, which the app scans using AI to recognize and list available ingredients along with their expiration dates. As food nears spoilage, the app sends alerts, suggests recipes tailored to whatâ€™s on hand, and even offers options to donate items directly to nearby food banks. By tracking whether items are used, wasted, shared, or donated, the app also helps users better understand their consumption habits while promoting smarter, more sustainable food choices.
